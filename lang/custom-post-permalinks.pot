"Permalinks settings for custom post types. You may use the same tags as "
"above in the permastructs. If you use %1$s, make sure the post type actually "
"uses categories and not another taxonomy. In addition to the normal tags "
"above, you may use the %2$s tag to match the rewrite slug for the post type. "
"Additionally, each post type has its own rewrite tag to match the name of "
"the post in the URL. Post type rewrite tags are beside their respective post "
"types."
