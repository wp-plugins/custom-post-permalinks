"Permalinks settings for custom post types. You may use the same tags as "
"above in the permastructs. Additionally, you may add a tag for any taxonomy "
"registered for a post type. For example, if you have a taxonomy called %1$s, "
"the tag would be %2$s. If the post type is not registered for a taxonomy, "
"the tag will be removed from the structure. In links that use taxonomies "
"other than categories, if a post is not assigned any terms, it will be "
"replaced by the word \"null\". To override this, define the constant %3$s in "
"%4$s with the string you wish to use. In addition to the normal tags above, "
"you may use the %5$s tag to match the rewrite slug for the post type. "
"Additionally, each post type has its own rewrite tag to match the name of "
"the post in the URL. Post type rewrite tags are beside their respective post "
"types."
