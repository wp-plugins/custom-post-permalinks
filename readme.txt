Custom Post Permalinks will set up permalinks for non-hierarchical custom post types which have the flexibility of blog post permalinks.

== Description ==

The plugin will set up custom post type permalinks for non-hierarchical permalinks which have the flexibility of blog post permalinks. So, for example, I could have a press release post type and set up permalinks like so:

http://my-site.com/press-releases/2010/08/great-news/

which would also enable post type specific archives:

http://my-site.com/press-releases/2010/08/
http://my-site.com/press-releases/2010/

Special thanks goes out to Aaron Jorbin for helping me with reviewing the code and making the plugin better in general.
